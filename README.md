# [Frender](https://frender-app.herokuapp.com/ "earlier version Heroku deploy")

Matches musicians with musicians using their preferred genres, skill level, musical influences, and complementary instruments. 
  
*_For example_*  
Angus plays guitar and is looking for a bassist and saxophonist that are professional musicians. He logs onto Frender.  
Duke plays saxophone professionally and is looking for a guitarist. He also has signed up with Frender.  
  
Angus hits the 'Search' knob on the Frender Amp.   
Compatible musicians will be shown in a carousel-like fashion.  
Duke's profile will eventually show up, revealing his credentials.  
Angus is intrigued, and clicks the "Les Dudis" option.   
Duke will be informed that Angus desires to play music with him, and can accept the invitation and schedule a time and place for a session to test each others' fit.  
  
Angus and Duke will go on to win 7 Grammys and define the sound of the hard jazz genre for generations to come.
